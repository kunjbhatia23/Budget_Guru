# Budget Guru - Personal Finance Management Dashboard

A comprehensive personal finance management application built with Next.js, TypeScript, and MongoDB, designed to provide clear financial insights for individuals and groups.

## Features

-   👤 **Multi-Profile & Group Management**: Create personal profiles, organize them into groups (e.g., family, roommates), and seamlessly switch between individual and group financial views.
-   🤝 **Advanced Expense Splitting**:
    -   Automatically calculate who owes whom in a group based on shared expenses, similar to Splitwise.
    -   "Settle Up" functionality to record payments between members, which accurately adjusts balances by creating corresponding `settlement_paid` and `settlement_received` transactions.
-   💰 **Group Income Distribution**: Add a single income transaction (e.g., business profit) and distribute it evenly among selected profiles within a group.
-   🎯 **Budget Tracking**: Set monthly budgets for various categories and track spending against your goals with real-time progress bars showing spent, remaining, and percentage used.
-   📈 **Visual Analytics**: Interactive charts for spending patterns by category and monthly trends over time.
-   📄 **Comprehensive Financial Reports**:
    -   Generate detailed monthly reports for any profile or group using a dedicated month-and-year picker.
    -   View summaries of income vs. expenses, breakdowns of spending by category, and budget vs. actual performance.
    -   Export reports to both **PDF** and **CSV** formats for record-keeping or sharing.
-   🎨 **Theme Customization**: Switch between **Dark** and **Light** mode for comfortable viewing day or night.
